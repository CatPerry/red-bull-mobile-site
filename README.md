# red-bull-mobile-site
Red Bull mockup mobile-first site

In this workshop I created a very simple mobile-first website for Red Bull US. I used the Red Bull US API and pure vanilla JavaScript to append all elements to the DOM rather than hard-coding them in. This creates a dynamic website that can be continuously updated via the Red Bull API and makes site updating easy-peasy.  

Since it's mobile-first, mobile-only and it was jsut an afternoon workshop, there arent any frills or Add to Cart functionality. but it' looks good.
